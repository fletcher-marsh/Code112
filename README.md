# Code112
VSCode extension for Python development - made for 15-112 at Carnegie Mellon University. This extension aims to provide the user with a quick, easy, and powerful environment for iterating on code quickly.

## Usage
This extension is in early stages of development, so currently only works on Python code.
 1. Install this extension through the VSCode Extension Manager

 2. Open up a file (or folder) you are working on (shortcut is <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd>)
 3. Compile/run it with <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> (Mac) <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> (Other)

That's it! Updates will potentially come out, requiring you to either do nothing (as vscode will apply the update automagically) or click a 'refresh vscode' button.
