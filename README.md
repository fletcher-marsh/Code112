# Code112
VSCode extension for Python development - made for 15-112 at Carnegie Mellon University. This extension aims to provide the user with a quick, easy, and powerful environment for iterating on code quickly.

## Usage
This extension is in early stages of development, so currently only works on Python code.
 1. Install this extension through the VSCode Extension Manager
 2. Open up a file you are working on
 3. Compile/run it with <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> (Mac) <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> (Other)

That's it!

## Features Planned
 - Expand on Windows support: more specifically, the Python binary can be found in various locations on Windows, so this projects needs something to suit most environments
 - If you have additional ideas, contact fletcher.r.marsh@gmail.com with the subject `Code112 Feature`
